# ABF_Algo
An algorithm to make the computer play in a number guessing game called ABF.


How to play the game:
    The game is about guessing the digits in the number the another play got in his mind. The number to be guessed has 4 digits, with all of them being distinct and not including zero. 
    You give him your guess in each round, and the other player gives you his response with numbers of A and B. An 'xA' where x is a number shows the number of numbers you have got in their place, while a 'yB' where
    y is a number shows the number of numbers you have got in your guess correctly but not in the right place. If you have numbers of both types, the response might be written as xAyB. The game goes on until the
    guesser gets the number right along with their position.
